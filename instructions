What to submit: A link to your group's GitHub repository. Both members of the group should post the same link. Make sure the visibility is set to public!

Include a markdown file in the repository titled DataGeneration.md which explains at least two different methods for data generation and storage, as well as your reasoning for preferring one method over the other(s).

Some things I will be looking for:


1) Run some quantitative tests - some obvious things include runtimes, memory usage, and read/write speeds. These results should be presented in a table and should back up your reasoning. Note that, especially when it comes to runtimes, you should run all tests on the same computers (i.e., don't test one method on computer A and another method on computer B). You should also generally run these kinds of tests multiple times and reports means and standard deviations.


2) Focus on clarity and readability in the code itself.


3) Make sure that I can easily re-run your tests if I choose. This should not be a complicated or cumbersome process - ideally, I would just have to run a "run_tests.py" script.


Feel free to use AI to help you write/debug your code and/or provide recommendations. Just make sure that you are always able to explain your code!

Target number of decks (for now) will be 2 million.
