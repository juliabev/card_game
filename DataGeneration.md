#### Method 1:
The first method 



#### Method 2:
Method 2 generates randomized decks and all possible combination match-ups and stores them in CSV files for later scoring and analysis. Each deck is built from 26 red (R) and 26 black (B) cards, shuffled randomly and stored as a string type. The decks are generated in batches, with 10,000 decks per file, to get 2 million decks at the end.
