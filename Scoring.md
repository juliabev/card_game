Scoring.md: Describe, in words, how your scoring logic works. Provide simple examples if that helps improve clarity. Include a brief discussion of how you arrived at this method, what else you tried, and how you measured/compared approaches.
In an appropriate folder, include a .csv file that shows wins, draws, etc. by the two different scoring methods for the 56 valid combinations of player choices. This does not need to be run on the full set of 2M decks yet, it just needs to include enough data to show that it is working.
