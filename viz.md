Visualization Instructions

Include the sample size in the title
Make sure the title includes which scoring method (By Tricks or By Cards)
Respect the ordering of the rows/columns. I'm just counting up in binary (B=0, R=1) from top to bottom, left to right.
Format the probabilities like I have: Win(Draw), both integers.
My cells are colored by the win probability
The vertical axis should be "Opponent choice", the horizontal axis is "My choice"
(New) Put a black box around the cell with the highest win probability in each row.


The code should include a function called augment_data(n: int). The function should create n new decks, and automatically update scores and figures.
