# ♦️ Project Penney 

## ♠️ Description

Penney's Game is a two player coin tossing game where each player will choose a sequence of heads (H) and tails (T) and the player with their sequence to first appear in the sequence of consecutive coin flips wins. Other variations of this game exist such as [Humble-Nishiyama Randomness Game](https://mathwo.github.io/assets/files/penney_game/humble-nishiyama_randomness_game-a_new_variation_on_penneys_coin_game.pdf)  which utilizes an ordinary deck of playing cards and follows the same format using red and black cards rather than heads and tails and the game iterates through the entire deck of cards. Each player chooses a sequence of three colors (e.g. player one chooses RRR and player two chooses BBB), and then starts the game by dealing the deck until the sequence appears. The game can either be scored by cards or by tricks, if its by cards, the player who has the most cards at the end of the deck gets one point, and if its by tricks, the player who has the most tricks (the collection of played cards) gets one point. The purpose of this project is to understand the strategy of choice in the game, and how it differs from scoring by cards or by tricks. The strategy that we are testing is if player two chooses not player one's second choice, then player one's first choice and lastly player one's second choice. For example, if player one chose **RRR**, player two would subsequently choose **BRR**, since the strategy goes (not 2 - 1 - 2). 



## ♥️ Quick-Start Guide

This project is managed using [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). If you do not yet have UV installed or need help troubleshooting issues with UV, refer to their [documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/features/). 

Once UV is installed, download the repository, navigate to the directory and run: `uv sync` to install dependencies.

Run the program

`uv run main.py -- augment 5000000` to create 5000000 new decks and automatically update scores and figures.
